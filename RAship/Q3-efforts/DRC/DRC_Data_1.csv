DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC) Hate speech ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Introduction: 
This lexicon investigates the landscape of hate speech and narratives in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Since 2014, PeaceTech Lab has undertaken research and worked with local partners in Nigeria, Cameroon, South Africa, South Sudan, Libya, Yemen and now the Democratic Republic of Congo, to understand the dynamics of online hate speech and the connection between online hate speech and violent events offline. This research attempts to address a gap in efforts to com- bat hate speech and to mitigate its effect on communities in conflict. Specifically, we are inter- ested in the process of identifying and contextualizing language that can contribute to violence. 
A steady increase in internet penetration as well as growth in the number of social media users are expected to increase the frequency of hate speech across all online platforms. This lexicon aims to serve as an initial guide to specific words and phrases identified during a finite period of time in the DRC. PeaceTech Lab intends for the lexicon to serve as a resource to inform individuals and organizations involved in monitoring and countering hate speech in the DRC so that their work can be more effective, as well as to contribute to general understanding of the phenomenon.
